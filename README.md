**⚡CodeSpark Hackathon: Lost & Found Board⚡** 
This project is a submission for the "HTML Only" challenge in the CodeSpark Hackathon, conducted by the Government Engineering College, Siwan. It is a static but functional webpage designed to serve as a digital lost and found board for the campus community.


1. Creativity & Originality
Use of Deprecated Attributes: To add color and improve the visual hierarchy without CSS, deprecated (but valid) HTML attributes like bgcolor and the <font> tag were used. This is a creative workaround that shows a deep understanding of HTML's capabilities.

Animation with <marquee>: The <marquee> tag was implemented to add a simple, HTML-only animation to the main title, making the page more dynamic and memorable.

2. Functionality
Clickable Contact Links: All contact information is interactive. Email addresses use mailto: links to open the user's default email client, and phone numbers use tel: links for one-tap calling on mobile devices.

Collapsible Details: The <details> and <summary> tags are used to create expandable sections for item descriptions. This adds a layer of interactivity and keeps the main table clean, all without any JavaScript.

3. UI/UX Design
Structured Layout: The entire page is built on a strong semantic structure using <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>.

Readable Tables: Information is organized into HTML <table> elements with borders and padding, which is the most effective way to present structured data clearly in an HTML-only environment.

4. Extra Effort
Semantic HTML5: The code uses modern HTML5 semantic tags, which improves accessibility and code clarity.

How to View
Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser to view the live page.
